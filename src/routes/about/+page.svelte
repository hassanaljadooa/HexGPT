				HexGPT is a purpose-built free and open source user interface created by <a
					href="https://twitter.com/aljahooda">Hassan</a
				> to streamline the process of generating color pallets through OpenAI's artificial intelligence
				model, GPT-3.5-Turbo, also known as the ChatGPT API.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Being able to visually see the pallet GPT generates makes it significantly easier for
				designers to adjust their prompts to generate more suitble pallets based on their prefrences
				or/ design guidelines.
